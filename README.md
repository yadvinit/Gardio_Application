# Gardio_Application

The purpose of this project is to develop a Gradio-based application that allows users to upload
a CSV file, ask questions—including numerical queries—about its contents, and receive
answers generated by a local Large Language Model (LLM). The application must also support
graph plotting, with all visualizations displayed within the Gradio interface.

Application Architecture
• Modularity:
• The system should be modular, with clear separation between:
• File handling
• Query processing using Pydantic AI
• LLM integration with Ollama
• Graph plotting
• Error Handling:
• Implement robust error handling for:
• CSV parsing errors
• User input validation
• LLM processing failures
